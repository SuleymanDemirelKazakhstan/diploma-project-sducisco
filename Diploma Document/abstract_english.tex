In our thesis, we decided to create a website on the discipline of computer networks for students of our university. The site will host educational materials, laboratory work and quizzes. We are currently using the official Cisco netacad website at our university. Answers to laboratory work and tests can be found on the Internet.We are constantly uploading new lab papers and various tests to our website so that our students can consolidate their knowledge and solve laboratory work on their own.We hope that a good command of computer networks in the future will bring more benefits than now, and will open up many opportunities.
